# SeqROCTM Matlab Toolbox
This is a toolbox for the statistical analysis of sequences of random objects driven by context tree models. The routines are collected in subdirectories according to the kind of functionality. The toolbox implements model selection methods for both SeqROCTM and context tree models. Besides, it includes algorithms to: simulate these kind of stochastic processes, tunne hyperparameters, compute complexity measures for context tree models, compute dissimilarity measures for context tree models, visualize context tree structure, among others.

It is written purely in Matlab language. It is self-cointained. There is no external dependency.

The software can be downloaded from GitHub and the installation instructions are also provided there.

## Installation

1. Download the toolbox to a local folder (e.g., ~/SeqROCTM/) by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/noslenh/SeqROCTM-Matlab-Toolbox.git
```

2. Run Matlab and navigate to the folder (~/SeqROCTM/), then run the init.m script.

3. Run some demos in ~/SeqROCTM/demo folder.

4. Help available at https://noslenh.github.io/SeqROCTM-Matlab-Toolbox/

function [H, Hmu, mu_ctx, Hmu_markovian] = EntropyRateCT(contexts, P, A)
%ENTROPYRATECT Compute the entropy rate of the stochastic process
%              represented by the context tree model. This is done by
%              representing the context tree model as a finite order Markov
%              chain and computing the entropy rate of such a Markovian
%              system
%
% Input
%
% 	contexts      : set of contexts
% 	P             : transition probabilities associated to the contexts
% 	A             : alphabet
%
% Output
%
% 	H             : entropy rate of the process
% 	Hmu           : entropy of the stationary distribution
% 	mu_ctx        : probability of occurrence of contexts (stationary distribution)
% 	Hmu_markovian : entropy of the stationary distribution of the Markovian system
